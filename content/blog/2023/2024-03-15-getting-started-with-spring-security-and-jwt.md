**[Spring Security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/index.html)** provides a comprehensive set of security features for Java applications, covering authentication, authorization, session management, and protection against common security threats such as [CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)](https://reflectoring.io/spring-csrf/).
The Spring Security framework is highly customizable and allows developers to curate security configurations depending on their application needs.
It provides a flexible architecture that supports various authentication mechanisms. The most widely used ones are Basic Authentication, JWT and OAuth. 
Spring Security provides Basic Authentication out of the box. To understand in detail about Spring Security basics and how it allows us to customize authentication and authorization, refer to [this article](https://reflectoring.io/spring-security/).
In this article, we will understand how JWT works and how we can configure it with spring security.
