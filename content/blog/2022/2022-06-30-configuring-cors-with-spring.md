Cross Origin Resource Sharing(CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows servers to explicitly whitelist certain 
origins and helps bypass the same-origin policy. This article will focus on the various ways in which CORS can be implemented in a Spring based application.
To understand how CORS works in detail, refer to this excellent [introductory article.](https://reflectoring.io/complete-guide-to-cors/)
